# PythonPong
based on a tutorial on pygame and python
implemented in python3 with pygame 1.9.2 (seems to be the only version of pygame to work with py3)

things to implement:
  i) collision detection
  ii) scoring system
  iii) menus, game states
  
I think I'll redo this in python2 at a later date, since py3 libraries are just too much of a hassle.
